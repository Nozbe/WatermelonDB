All the files in this directory are copied from stock android. The following
files:

JNIHelp.cpp
ALog-priv.h

are copied in from Android's libnativehelper module (altogether less than 1000
lines of code). The remainder are from the core framework (directory
/frameworks/base/core/jni).

Notes on changes:

The ashmem_XXX() interfaces are used for the various "xxxForBlobDescriptor()"
API functions. The code in libcutils for this seems to be platform
dependent - some platforms have kernel support, others have a user space
implementation. So these functions are not supported for now.

The original SQLiteConnection.cpp uses AndroidRuntime::genJNIEnv() to obtain a
pointer to the current threads environment. Changed to store a pointer to the
process JavaVM (Android allows only one) as a global variable. Then retrieve
the JNIEnv as needed using GetEnv().

Replaced uses of class String8 with std::string in SQLiteConnection.cpp and a
few other places.

The "LOCALIZED" collation and some miscellaneous user-functions added by the
sqlite3_android.cpp module are not included. A collation called LOCALIZED
that is equivalent to BINARY is added instead to keep various things working.
This should not cause serious problems - class SQLiteConnection always
runs "REINDEX LOCALIZED" immediately after opening a connection.
