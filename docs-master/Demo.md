Note that where Watermelon really shines is in React Native apps — see instructions below ⬇️

## Running React Native demo

To compile the WatermelonDB demo on your own machine:

1. Install [React Native toolkit](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html) if you haven't already
2. Download this project
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Nozbe/WatermelonDB.git
    cd WatermelonDB/examples/native
    yarn
    ```
3. Run the React Native packager:
    ```bash
    yarn dev
    ```
4. Run the app on iOS or Android:
    ```bash
    yarn start:ios # or:
    yarn start:android
    ```

⚠️ Note that for accurate measurement of performance, you need to compile the demo app in Release mode and run it on a real device, not the simulator.

⚠️ If iOS app doesn't compile, try running it from Xcode instead of the terminal first

⚠️  You might want to `git checkout` the [latest stable tag](https://github.com/Nozbe/WatermelonDB/releases) if the demo app doesn't work

## Running web demo

To compile the WatermelonDB demo on your own machine:

1. Download this project
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Nozbe/WatermelonDB.git
    cd WatermelonDB/examples/web
    yarn
    ```
2. Run the server:
    ```bash
    yarn dev
    ```
3. Webpack will point you to the right URL to open in the browser

You can also [use Now](https://zeit.co/now) to deploy the demo app (requires a Zeit account):

```bash

```

⚠️  You might want to `git checkout` the [latest stable tag](https://github.com/Nozbe/WatermelonDB/releases) if the demo app doesn't work
