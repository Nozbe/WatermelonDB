# Create, Read, Update, Delete

When you have your [Schema](./Schema.md) and [Models](./Model.md) defined, learn how to manipulate them!

## Reading

#### Get a collection

The `Collection` object is how you find, query, and create new records of a given type.

```js
const postsCollection = database.get('posts')
```

Pass the [table name](./Schema.md) as the argument.

#### Find a record (by ID)

```js
const postId = 'abcdefgh'
const post = await database.get('posts').find(postId)
```

`find()` returns a Promise. If the record cannot be found, the Promise will be rejected.

#### Query records

Find a list of records matching given conditions by making a Query and then fetching it:

```js
const allPosts = await database.get('posts').query().fetch()
const numberOfStarredPosts = await database.get('posts').query(
  Q.where('is_starred', true)
).fetchCount()
```

## Modifying the database

All modifications to the database (like creating, updating, deleting records) must be done **in a Writer**, either by wrapping your work in `database.write()`:

```js
await database.write(async () => {
  const comment = await database.get('comments').find(commentId)
  await comment.update(() => {
    comment.isSpam = true
  })
})
```

Or by defining a `@writer` method on a Model:

```js
import { writer } from '@nozbe/watermelondb/decorators'

class Comment extends Model {
  // (...)
  @writer async markAsSpam() {
    await this.update(comment => {
      comment.isSpam = true
    })
  }
}
```

### Create a new record

```js
const newPost = await database.get('posts').create(post => {
  post.title = 'New post'
  post.body = 'Lorem ipsum...'
})
```

`.create()` takes a "builder function". In the example above, the builder will get a `Post` object as an argument. Use this object to set values for [fields you defined](./Model.md).

**Note:** Always `await` the Promise returned by `create` before you access the created record.

**Note:** You can only set fields inside `create()` or `update()` builder functions.

### Update a record

```js
await somePost.update(post => {
  post.title = 'Updated title'
})
```

Like creating, updating takes a builder function, where you can use field setters.

**Note:** Always `await` the Promise returned by `update` before you access the modified record.

### Delete a record

There are two ways of deleting records: syncable (mark as deleted), and permanent.

If you only use Watermelon as a local database, destroy records permanently, if you [synchronize](./Advanced/Sync.md), mark as deleted instead.

```js
await somePost.markAsDeleted() // syncable
await somePost.destroyPermanently() // permanent
```

**Note:** Do not access, update, or observe records after they're deleted.

## Advanced

- `Model.observe()` - usually you only use this [when connecting records to components](./Components.md), but you can manually observe a record outside of React components. The returned [RxJS](https://github.com/reactivex/rxjs) `Observable` will emit the record immediately upon subscription, and then every time the record is updated. If the record is deleted, the Observable will complete.
- `Query.observe()`, `Relation.observe()` — analagous to the above, but for [Queries](./Query.md) and [Relations](./Relation.md)
- `Query.observeWithColumns()` - used for [sorted lists](./Components.md)
- `Collection.findAndObserve(id)` — same as using `.find(id)` and then calling `record.observe()`
- `Model.prepareUpdate()`, `Collection.prepareCreate`, `Database.batch` — used for [batch updates](./Writers.md)
- `Database.unsafeResetDatabase()` destroys the whole database - [be sure to see this comment before using it](https://github.com/Nozbe/WatermelonDB/blob/22188ee5b6e3af08e48e8af52d14e0d90db72925/src/Database/index.js#L131)
- To override the `record.id` during the creation, e.g. to sync with a remote database, you can do it by `record._raw` property. Be aware that the `id` must be of type `string`.
    ```js
    await database.get('posts').create(post => {
      post._raw.id = serverId
    })
    ```

### Advanced: Unsafe raw execute

⚠️ Do not use this if you don't know what you're doing...

There is an escape hatch to drop down from WatermelonDB to underlying database level to execute arbitrary commands. Use as a last resort tool:

```js
await database.write(() => {
  // sqlite:
  await database.adapter.unsafeExecute({
    sqls: [
      // [sql_query, [placeholder arguments, ...]]
      ['create table temporary_test (id, foo, bar)', []],
      ['insert into temporary_test (id, foo, bar) values (?, ?, ?)', ['t1', true, 3.14]],
    ]
  })

  // lokijs:
  await database.adapter.unsafeExecute({
    loki: loki => {
      loki.addCollection('temporary_test', { unique: ['id'], indices: [], disableMeta: true })
      loki.getCollection('temporary_test').insert({ id: 't1', foo: true, bar: 3.14 })
    }
  })
})
```
