# WatermelonDB Roadmap

Despite being called 0.xx, WatermelonDB is essentially feature-complete and relatively API stable. It's used in production by [Nozbe Teams](https://nozbe.com) and many others.

We don't call it 1.0 mostly out of convenience, to allow rapid development without incrementing `major` version counter (as dictated by SemVer). We do intend to call WatermelonDB a 1.0 once we can reach a long-term stable API.

### v1.0

- Optimized tree deleting
- Long term stable API

### Beyond 1.0

- Full transactionality (atomicity) support?
- Field sanitizers
