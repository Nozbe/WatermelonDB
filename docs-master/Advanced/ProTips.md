# Various Pro Tips

## Database viewer

[See discussion](https://github.com/Nozbe/WatermelonDB/issues/710)

**Android** - you can use the new [App Inspector](https://medium.com/androiddevelopers/database-inspector-9e91aa265316) in modern versions of Android Studio.

**Via Flipper** You can also use Facebook Flipper [with a plugin](https://github.com/panz3r/react-native-flipper-databases#readme). See [discussion](https://github.com/Nozbe/WatermelonDB/issues/653).

**iOS** - check open database path in iOS System Log (via Console for plugged-in device, or Xcode logs, or [by using `find`](https://github.com/Nozbe/WatermelonDB/issues/710#issuecomment-776255654)), then open it via `sqlite3` in the console, or an external tool like [sqlitebrowser](https://sqlitebrowser.org)

## Prepopulating database on native

There's no built-in support for this. One way is to generate a SQLite DB (you can use the the Node SQLite support in 0.19.0-2 pre-release or extract it from an ios/android app), bundle it with the app, and then use a bit of code to check if the DB you're expecting it available, and if not, making a copy of the default DB â€” before you attempt loading DB from JS side.
