# Changelog

## Unreleased

### BREAKING CHANGES

- [Query] `Q.where(xxx, undefined)` will now throw an error. This is a bug fix, since comparing to
  undefined was never allowed and would either error out or produce a wrong result in some cases.
  However, it could technically break an app that relied on existing buggy behavior

### Deprecations

### New features

- [adapters] Adapter objects can now be distinguished by checking their `static adapterType`
- [Query] New `Q.includes('foo')` query for case-sensitive exact string includes comparison
- [adapters] Adapter objects now returns `dbName`
- [TypeScript] Add unsafeExecute method

### Performance

- [LokiJS] Updated Loki with some performance improvements
- [iOS] JSLockPerfHack now works on iOS 15
- Improved `@json` decorator, now with optional `{ memo: true }` parameter

### Changes

- [Docs] Added additional Android JSI installation step

### Fixes
