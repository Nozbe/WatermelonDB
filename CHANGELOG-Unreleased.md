# Changelog

## Unreleased

### Highlights

- [iOS] Older version of iOS Installation docs said to import WatermelonDB's `SupportingFiles/Bridging.h` from your app project's `Bridging.h`.
  This is no longer recommended, and you should remove this import from your project. If this removal causes build issues, please file an issue.
- [iOS] Watermelon should now work when using CocoaPods in the `use_frameworks!` mode without workarounds (note that we highly recommend _not_ using frameworks, however this is relevant to users of some React Native modules that require it)

### BREAKING CHANGES

- [iOS] In your Podfile, make the following change:

    ```rb
    # replace this:
    pod 'simdjson', path: '../node_modules/@nozbe/simdjson'
    # with this:
    pod 'simdjson', path: '../node_modules/@nozbe/simdjson', modular_headers: true
    ```

    This was required to support `use_frameworks!`

### Deprecations

### New features

### Fixes
