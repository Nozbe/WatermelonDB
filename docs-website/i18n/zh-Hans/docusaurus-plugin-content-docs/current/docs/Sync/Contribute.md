1. If you implement Watermelon sync but found this guide confusing, please contribute improvements!
2. Please help out with solving the current limitations!
3. If you write server-side code made to be compatible with Watermelon, especially for popular platforms (Node, Ruby on Rails, Kinto, etc.) - please open source it and let us know! This would dramatically simplify implementing sync for people
4. If you find Watermelon sync bugs, please report the issue! And if possible, write regression tests to make sure it never happens again
